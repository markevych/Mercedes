				<p>
					Until 1994, Mercedes-Benz utilized an alphanumeric system for categorizing their vehicles, 
					consisting of a number sequence approximately equal to the engine's displacement in liters multiplied by 100, 
					followed by an arrangement of alphabetical suffixes indicating body style and engine type
				</p>				
			</div>
			<div class="intro">

				<p>
					"C" indicates a coupe or cabriolet body style (for example, the CL and CLK models, though the C-Class is an exception, 
					since it is also available as a sedan or station wagon).
					"D" indicates the vehicle is equipped with a diesel engine.
					"E" (for "Einspritzung") indicates the vehicle's engine is equipped with petrol fuel injection. 
					Also used for electric models and plug-in hybrids.
					"G" was originally used for the Gel√§ndewagen off-road vehicle, 
					but is now applied to Mercedes SUVs in general (G, GLA, GLC, GLE and GLS).

				<p>
					"K" was used in the 1930s, indicating a supercharger ("Kompressor") equipped engine. Two exceptions : the SSK and CLK, where K indicates "Kurz" (short-wheelbase) (though the SSK had a supercharger).
					"L" indicates "Leicht" (lightweight) for sporting models, and "Lang" (long-wheelbase) for sedan models.
					"R" indicates "Rennen" (racing), used for racing cars (for example, the 300SLR).
					"S" Sonderklasse "Special class" for flagship models, including the S-Class, and the SL-Class, SLR McLaren and SLS sportscars.
					"T" indicates "Touring" and an estate (or station wagon) body style.

					Some models in the 1950s also had lower-case letters (b, c, and d) to indicate specific trim levels. 
					For other models, the numeric part of the designation does not match the engine displacement. 
					This was done to show the model's position in the model range independent of displacement or in the price matrix. 
					For these vehicles, the actual displacement in liters is suffixed to the model designation.  
					Some older models (such as the SS and SSK) did not have a number as part of the designation at all.</p>

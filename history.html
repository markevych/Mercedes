				Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first petrol-powered car, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, 
				financed by Bertha Benz and patented in January 1886,
				and Gottlieb Daimler and engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year. 
				The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft. (Daimler Motors Corporation).

				Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was popular during Germany's Nazi period. 
				Adolf Hitler was known to have driven these cars during his time in power, with bulletproof windshields.
				Most of the surviving models have been sold at auctions to private buyers. 
				One of them is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. 
				The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz.
